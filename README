	Need to give option to change graphics quality, ie low graphics we just use 1 background image rather than parallax. Don't AA polygons.

	Enemy, Player and Bullet could all easily inherit from a base class that knows how to draw itself and integrate equations of motion.

	Options screen to toggle graphics and view controls.
