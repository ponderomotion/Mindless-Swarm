GETTING IT RUNNING:
	Windows:
		First you'll need python2.7:
			http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi
		Then you'll need to install pygame:
			http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi
		Then you'll need to download the assets and put them in the laika folder under /assets/:
			https://dl.dropbox.com/u/322482/assets.zip
		


AIM:

	Stay alive for as long as you can! Get extra points for killing enemies. Don't get sucked into a passing planet's gravity.

CONTROLS:

	w - forward engine
	s - reverse engine
	a - rotate anticlockwise
	d - rotate clockwise

	f - toggle fullscreen
	esc - pause/quit

TODO:

	2 player with modes:
		survival:
			Whoever stays alive longest wins, no pvp
		vs:
			Whoever scores highest wins, pvp
		head-to-head:
			pvp, score irrelevant.
	
	Need to give option to change graphics quality, ie low graphics we just use 1 background image rather than parallax. Don't AA polygons.

	Enemy, Player and Bullet could all easily inherit from a base class that knows how to draw itself and integrate equations of motion.

	Options screen to toggle graphics and view controls.
